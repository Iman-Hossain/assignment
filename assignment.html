            <p>It would not be long before I started getting more website projects. I started by using html/css templates that I could easily implement and customize and I cranked out several websites in this fashion. It also helped to refresh and expand my limited development knowledge base.But I knew I had I had to jump into CMS headfirst if I was really going to take the web design portion of my business any further.</p>
